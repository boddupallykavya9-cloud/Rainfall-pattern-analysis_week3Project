# Rainfall Pattern Analysis

## Project Overview

This project analyzes IMD rainfall data to uncover temporal patterns, seasonal cycles, and extreme weather events. It demonstrates advanced data preprocessing, visualization, and insight generation using Python (Jupyter/Colab) and Excel reporting.

## Files and Structure

- `Rainfall_pattern_analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing all code for data import, cleaning, processing, visualization, and summary generation.
- `Rainfall_pattern_analysis.xlsx`: Excel workbook with worksheet tabs for monthly, seasonal, and yearly rainfall aggregates, including charts and written insights.

## Methodology

1. The notebook loads raw rainfall data and performs exploratory analysis.
2. It aggregates the precipitation data into monthly, seasonal averages, and yearly totals.
3. Visualizations (bar, line, scatter plots) highlight monsoon peaks, dry spells, and climate variability.
4. Outlier detection flags extreme rainfall events.
5. Aggregate results are exported to Excel for clean reporting.

## Key Findings

- Monsoon months (July-September) show peak rainfall.
- March and April are consistently dry across years.
- Annual rainfall trends suggest periodic wet/dry cycles.
- Notable spikes represent potential extreme weather events.

## Recommendations

- Enhance water storage and flood prevention for monsoon months.
- Investigate outlier events for risk planning and disaster management.
- Consider developing predictive models for rainfall forecast and anomaly detection.

## How to Reproduce

1. Open or run the `.ipynb` notebook in Colab or Jupyter.
2. Download the processed results and open the Excel workbook for interactive charting and reporting.
